It seems like you're looking for examples of how to use `jq` with `kubectl get pods nginx -o json`. Below are a few practical examples of how you can query and filter the JSON output from `kubectl` using `jq`.

### 1. **Print Pod Name and Creation Timestamp**

If you want to print the name of the pod and its creation timestamp, you can extract this information from the `metadata` section of the JSON output.

kubectl get pods nginx -o json | jq -r '.metadata.name + " " + .metadata.creationTimestamp'


**Example Output:**
nginx 2024-12-26T06:42:23Z


### 2. **Print Pod Name and Container Image**

You can extract the pod's name and the container image being used in the pod.

kubectl get pods nginx -o json | jq -r '.metadata.name + " " + .spec.containers[0].image'


**Example Output:**

nginx nginx


This assumes there’s only one container in the pod (`containers[0]`). If there are multiple containers, you can modify the query to target the right index or loop through all containers.

### 3. **Get the Pod's IP Address**

If you want to get the IP address assigned to the pod, you can access the `status` section and look for `podIP`.

kubectl get pods nginx -o json | jq -r '.status.podIP'


**Example Output:**


192.168.1.4


### 4. **Check if Pod has a `startTime` and Print it**

If you want to check if the pod has a `startTime` and print it, you can use the `select` function in `jq` to filter pods that have a `startTime` field.

kubectl get pods nginx -o json | jq -r 'select(.status.startTime != null) | .metadata.name + " started at " + .status.startTime'

**Example Output:**


nginx started at 2024-12-26T06:45:23Z


If the `startTime` field is `null` or missing, the pod will be skipped.

### 5. **List Pod Names with Labels**

If you want to get the names of the pod along with its labels, you can extract the labels from the `metadata` section.

kubectl get pods nginx -o json | jq -r '.metadata.name + " Labels: " + (.metadata.labels | tostring)'


**Example Output:**

nginx Labels: {"run":"nginx"}`

### 6. **Get Pod's Node Name**

You can get the node name where the pod is running by looking at the `nodeName` field in the `status` section.

kubectl get pods nginx -o json | jq -r '.status.nodeName'

**Example Output:**


node-1234


### 7. **Get Detailed Information (All Fields)**

If you want to see all the details of the `nginx` pod in a readable format, you can just output the whole JSON with `jq`:

bash
kubectl get pods nginx -o json | jq .


This will print the entire pod's JSON structure, which you can then manually inspect for any other fields of interest.

### 8. **Get Container's Resource Requests and Limits**

If you are interested in the resource requests and limits of containers in the pod, you can use this query:

bash
kubectl get pods nginx -o json | jq -r '.spec.containers[] | .name + " - CPU Requests: " + (.resources.requests.cpu // "None") + ", Memory Requests: " + (.resources.requests.memory // "None")'


This will list the resource requests for each container within the pod.

**Example Output:**


nginx - CPU Requests: None, Memory Requests: None
```

### 9. **Check Pod's Restart Count**

To get the restart count of the container (useful to know if the container has crashed), you can use the following command:

get pods nginx -o json | jq -r '.status.containerStatuses[] | .name + " Restart Count: " + (.restartCount | tostring)'

**Example Output:**
nginx Restart Count: 0


This will show the restart count for each container inside the pod. If the pod only has one container (e.g., `nginx`), it will just display that.

---

### Recap of Key Concepts:

- **`kubectl get pods nginx -o json`**: Fetches the pod details in JSON format.
- **`jq -r`**: Processes the JSON output and outputs it as raw text.
- **Key Sections**:
  - `.metadata.name`: The pod’s name.
  - `.spec.containers`: Information about the container(s) in the pod.
  - `.status`: Current status of the pod, including IP, node name, and restart count.

By using these `jq` examples, you can extract almost any information you need from the JSON output of `kubectl get pods`. Let me know if you need any more specific examples!
